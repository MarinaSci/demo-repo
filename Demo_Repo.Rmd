## R Markdown

library(usethis) #for nice interactions with Git/Github
library(gitcredits) #for functions that help set up a PAT 
library(credentials)
library(gert)
library(gh)

use_git_config(user.name = "MarinaSci", user.email = "mpapaiakovou@gmail.com") #you don't have to use the same Github name - definitely use the same email 


#create a github token - save it somewhere, it will expire for security reasons 

create_github_token() #it will take you to the home page, create a new token 
gitcreds_set() #you will paste your PAT there 

#sudo scutil --set HostName your_new_name - I used this so I can change the name of my computer in the terminal - my iphone was appearing, 
#apparently it's harmless 


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
